## Introduction [&#x219F;](#contents)

> When I first came here, this was all yak hair. Everyone said I was daft to build a yurt on the Endless High Plain of Yak, but I built in all the same, just to show them. It sank into the Plains of Yak. So I built a second one. That sank into the Plains of Yak. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the Plains of Yak. But the fourth one stayed up. And that's what you're going to get, the strongest yak hair yurt on the Endless High Plain of Yak.

Build for failure? No! Build to burn down, fall over, and sink into the Plains of Yak!

This is the source code that generates the site for the [LFE documentation][docs].


## Development [&#x219F;](#contents)

The vision for the new LFE docs site is outlined in a series of epic tickets (as well as in various emails on the LFE mail list) linked here in this meta-epic (oh yeah, we took it up a level):

* [https://github.com/lfe/docs/issues/62](https://github.com/lfe/docs/issues/62)

v3 of the LFE docs site has been forked from v1. It will use some of the CSS of v2 (heavily borrowing from Github's API site), and when done, should be able to be merged back into the regular docs site (thus preserving the contributions made by community members to-date).

This particular repo is infrastructural only -- it's aim is to produce a tool that we can use to generate the LFE docs site without having to rely on Ruby or Github's gh-pages features (which we have not been entirely happy with; but hey, you can't please all the people all the time ... espeically the fringe Lispers who write distributed systems).


### Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

* Erlang
* ``rebar3``
* ``sass`` (use ``make sass`` to install; requires Ruby + ``gem`` to be installed)


### Building [&#x219F;](#contents)

The CSS files are managed with [sass](http://sass-lang.com). After changing values in ``priv/sass/lfe-theme.scss`` (or in the ``priv/sass/_variables.scss`` file), you'll need to rebuild:

```bash
$ make css
```

To run a local copy of the development server and view your work at [http://localhost:5099](http://localhost:5099), run the following:

```bash
$ make devdocs
```

This will automatically rebuild the CSS and build the docs before running the server.

To just build the docs:

```bash
$ make docs
```

This runs the LFE code which is generating the site (details are logged to the console).
