# Quick Start

## 2 Your First LFE Project

A project? Already?! It sounds daunting, but it's just one command :-)

Head over to your favorite workspace in an open terminal and do this:

```bash
$ lfetool new library my-test-lib
```

As you watch the output crank away, read on to find out what it's doing:

* ``lfetool`` created a skeleton project (of the "library" type)
* ``rebar`` downloaded all the dependencies listed in the new
  ``rebar.config`` file that was created for your project
* All the downloaded dependendencies were then compiled
* During the first step, a failing test case was created for you; now, that
  test case has been run in the test suite and the error has been revealed
  (TDD!)


### 2.1 Tests First!

First things first: let's get that failing unit test passing.

Here's the output we saw:

```erlang
**error:{assertEqual_failed,[{module,'my-test-lib_tests'},
                     {line,11},
                     {expression,"(: my-test-lib my-adder 2 2)"},
                     {expected,4},
                     {value,5}]}
```

We can see that our test expected 4 but it got 5.

Before we go further, be sure you are in your project directory:

```bash
$ cd my-test-lib
```

Let's look at the test by opening up ``test/my-test-lib_tests.lfe``.

Well, things there look good -- we should get 4 when 2 and 2 are added.

Let's take a look at the source module: ``src/my-test-lib.lfe``. Ah-ha! a
bug :-) There's an extra operation that's being done which we don't want.

To fix it, change this line:

```lisp
  (+ x (+ y 1)))
```

to this:

```lisp
  (+ x y))
```

Now re-run the unit tests:

```bash
$ make check-unit
```

And you should get a passing test:

```bash
==> my-test-lib (eunit)
======================== EUnit ========================
my-test-lib_tests: my-adder_test (module 'my-test-lib_tests')...[0.031 s] ok
=======================================================
  Test passed.
```

We'll talk about the ``make`` targets in a bit, but our target above run the
unit tests without recompiling all the deps; just our project files and
our unit tests.


### 2.2 Project Inventory

Okay, we've got our tests passing and our project looks healthy. But what does
it have in it?

* a Markdown formatted README file
* a ``Makefile``
* the ``rebar.config`` file we mentioned earlier (this has all your project
  dependencies in it)
* a ``package.exs`` file for uploading your project to
  <a href="http://expm.co">expm.co</a>
* the ``src`` directory which holds your project code, and
* the ``test`` directory which holds the tests

There are some other things there (e.g., the ``deps`` directory created by ``rebar``
and the ``ebin`` directory that's created when everything is compiled).


### 2.3 Repo Ready to Go

``lfetool`` also did one more thing for you: ``init``ed the project in git
and added all the files:

```bash
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   .gitignore
#   new file:   .travis.yml
#   new file:   Makefile
#   new file:   README.md
#   new file:   package.exs
#   new file:   rebar.config
#   new file:   resources/make/common.mk
#   new file:   src/my-test-lib-util.lfe
#   new file:   src/my-test-lib.app.src
#   new file:   src/my-test-lib.lfe
#   new file:   test/my-test-lib_tests.lfe
#
```
All you need to do it ``git commit -a && git push --all`` to wherever you want
to put your project :-)


### Next Stop

You can taste it, can't you? That LFE flavor coming your way? Yup, you're right.
