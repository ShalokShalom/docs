# Tutorial: Counter Application

## 1 Introduction

This example application is inspired by [this blog post](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/10/26/Messaging). The following is an excerpt from the article:

"Let’s suppose we’ve got a program we want to smash across lots of cores, and we want it to count things. The counts aren’t going to be reported out till the program finishes, so there’s no reason for the main workload to wait for the counting arithmetic. So the obvious thing to do is to run the counters off in their own thread(s), send them please-count messages (no need to wait for the answers), and the numbers will all get added up eventually."

This tutorial will demonstrate how to create the same application in LFE...
