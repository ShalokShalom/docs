# LFE Features

## The Erlang Inheritance

### Language Properties

* Lightweight concurrency
* Asynchronous communication
* Error handling
* Process isolation
* Continuous evolution of system
* High-level language

### Influencing Factors

* No global data
* No mutable data
* Standard Erlang data types
* Pattern matching and guards
* Erlang functions (with name and arity)
* Erlang modules
* Compiler and interpreter

## The Lisp Inheritance

* Functions and variables have separate namespaces (LFE is a Lisp-2)
* Macros (unhygenic) with the added benefit of supporting pattern matching
* Homoinconicity
* Easy conceptual mapping between LFE and decades of Lisp software

## LFE-Specific Features

* Three-pass compiler (macro expansion, linting, code-generation)
* Generates Core Erlang
* New work on LFE REPL will support function and macro definition in the REPL
* Full interoperability with Erlang/OTP and third-party Erlang libraries
* Java interop via JInterface and Erjang

## Hipster Appeal

* A "rare" language, more fringe than Erlang proper
* A younger cousin to Clojure (released in 2008) that far fewer programmers
  know about
* Actor model
* Lisp!
* Create your own compilers
* DSLs galore
* Metaprogramming
* FP
* Heavily inspired by Common Lisp and Scheme
* Borrows some ideas from Elixir and Clojure
* The Banarama of languages
* Open
* Telecom
* Platform
* Itâ€™s a language out of a language out of Sweden that can be used to build web
  scale, asynchronous, non-blocking, sharded, event driven, message passing,
  NoSQL, reliable, highly available, high performance, real time, clusterable,
  bad ass, rock star, get the girls, get the boys, impress your mom, impress
  your cat applications
* You can blast it in the face with a shotgun and it keeps on coming
* C10k what?
* Utterly terrifying
* 19 billion dollars
