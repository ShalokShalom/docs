# LFE Style Guide

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Purpose

LFE has, since its inception in 2008, become increasinly popular in the
Erlang and Lisp communities. Contributions to the source code, examples,
third-party libraries, and LFE-based applications have steadily risen and are
currently undergoing a sharp increase.

As such, our community now has the need for resources we can provide for
new-comers -- both to assist in their LFE literacy as well as make
contributions easier to write and then get approved for merge.

In summary, this guide recommends formatting and stylistic choices designed
to make your code easier for other people to understand.

### 1.2 License

The material in this document is licensed under
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons 3.0
BY</a>, the same license as the majority of the source material in the
<a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lispguide.xml">The
Common Lisp Style Guide</a>.

### 1.3 Sources

The LFE Style Guide has several sources. The majority of the text is taken
directly from the
<a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lispguide.xml">The
Common Lisp Style Guide</a>.

Additional sources include the following:

* <a href="http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">Tutorial on Good Lisp
  Programming Style</a>
* <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">The
  Common Lisp HyperSpec</a>.
* <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc.html">Erlang Documentation</a>
* <a href="/prog-rules/1.html">LFE Programming Rules and Conventions</a>
* Conversations, emails, and IRC chats with Robert Virding, creator of LFE
  (and co-creator of Erlang).

### 1.4 Differences from The Common Lisp Style Guide

Large portions of the Common Lisp Style Guide are more formal or too specific
to Common Lisp itself to be appropriate for the LFE Style Guide. As such,
that content has not been adapted to LFE.

The recent versions of the Common Lisp Style Guide are targeted at Lisp usage
inside Google. The LFE Style Guide changes the portions of the guide focused
on groups inside Google to instead refer to the larger open source community,
the Erlang community, or the LFE community and associated projects.
