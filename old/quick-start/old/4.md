### 4.1 Using make

We promised to come back to ``make``, so here we are.

Eventually, the ``Makefile`` will be replaced with a combination of ``rebar``
scripts and updates to ``lfetool``, but for now it's what we've got.

There are some convenient targets available for you in the ``Makefile``:

* ``upload`` - when your project's ready for release, this will push it up to
  <a href="http://expm.co/">expm.co</a> for you
* ``compile`` - rebuilds all your ``.beam``s, including the dependencies
* ``install`` - should you wish to install your project system-wide (we recommend
  against it), you could use this target to do it
* ``check`` - run your unit tests after recompiling all ``*.lfe`` files ``*.beam``
* ``repl`` - start up the LFE REPL after recompiling all ``*.lfe`` files
* ``shell`` - start up the Erlang shell after recompiling all ``*.lfe`` files
* ``get-deps`` - not only does this target get your deps initially, but subsequent
  runs of it will perform ``git pull``s for the repos cloned in your ``deps``
  dir, ensuring you have the latest code for everything

If you do not need to recompile dependencies (and most of the time, you don't),
you can skip the deps with the following targets:

* ``compile-no-deps``
* ``repl-no-deps``
* ``shell-no-deps``
* ``check-unit``

There are other interesting ``make`` targets tucked in the ``Makefile``, and
you can learn more about how to manage LFE projects by checking them out.

### 4.2 Next Steps

This has been a quick overview of what LFE has to offer, so you might enjoy
reading the <a href="/user-guide/intro/1.html">User Guide</a>
next. You can see all our docs at a glance by visiting the
<a href="/">Docs</a> page.

There is a <a href="http://docs.lfe.io/tutorials/processes/1.html">tutorial
on light-weight Erlang processes</a> in LFE that you may be intersted in.

If you want to develop RESTful services in LFE, you should take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/lfe/yaws-rest-starter">REST on YAWS with LFE</a>
starter project.

The <a href="https://github.com/lfe">LFE organization</a> on Gitub has a large
collection of LFE projects that may be of interest to you.

You should also take some time reading the
<a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe">examples</a> provided in the LFE
source code; studying examples is the quickest way to make progress.
