# Quick Start

## 1 Going Plaid

     style="float: right;">
This guide will give you what you need in order to jump into LFE at ludicrous
speed.

For a more gradual introduction (with a bit more Erlang) and for
something that's going to give you time to see the stars, checkout the
<a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/1.html">User Guide</a>.


### 1.1 lfetool

For a quick introduction to LFE, ``lfetool`` has everything you need. The
Quick Start guide will use it almost exclusively -- all in the interst of
sending you a week and a half into the future.

Where appropriate, we will point you to other resources that provide more
details.

Let's get started: install ``lfetool``! This puts it in ``/usr/local/bin``:

```bash
$ curl -L -o ./lfetool \
    https://raw.github.com/lfe/lfetool/stable/lfetool
$ bash lfetool install 
```

If you would like to instal it in a directory of your choosing:

```bash
$ bash lfetool install lfetool /opt/scripts/bin
```

Note that ``lfetool`` supports Erlang R15, R16, and 17.0.

If you need ``sudo`` to put the script there, be sure to set the ownership:

```bash
$ chown $USER /usr/local/bin/lfetool
```

That way you'll be able to use the ``update`` command to get the latest version
of ``lfetool`` in the future.


### 1.2 Other Dependencies

First and foremost, you will need Erlang installed. On Mac OS X, this is as
easy as executing ```brew install erlang``` or on Ubuntu ```apt-get install
erlang```. You can also install Erlang from the various pre-built packages
provided on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">official Erlang
download page</a> or from the
<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp">Erlang
Solutions page</a> (supports many more package types).

Personally, we prefer to manage our Erlang builds and installations with
<a href="https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl">kerl</a>.
This allows for multiple versions of Erlang to be installed
on your system simultaneously. For more information about using ``kerl`` in LFE
projects, be sure to visit the "kerl" section of the
<a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/4.html">User Guide</a>.

You will be using ```rebar``` to build LFE under the covers as well as managing
dependencies for your projects, so go ahead and get that set up:
<a href="https://github.com/basho/rebar">get rebar</a>.

You will also need to <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download git</a> or
install it using your favorite package manager.
