    - 1956 through 1962. The paper presented by John McCarthy at the
    <a href="http://research.ihost.com/hopl/HOPL-I.html">first HOPL conference</a>
    in 1978.

    <a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/resources/papers/Evolution-of-Lisp.pdf">The Evolution of Lisp</a>
    - 1960 through 1992. The paper by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel at
    <a href="http://research.ihost.com/hopl/HOPL-II.html">HOPL II</a> in 1993
    which picks up where McCarthy left off in his 1978 paper.

    <a href="http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/">History of LISP</a>
    - This is an amazing resource which aims to preserve as much Lisp history
    as possible. (The Software Preservation Group is backed by the world-class
    Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, USA.)

    <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102703236">Herbert Stoyan collection on LISP programming</a>
    - The Herbert Stoyan collection on LISP programming contains materials
    documenting the origins, evolution, and use of the LISP programming

<h4>Actor Model</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-73/PDF/027B.pdf">A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence</a>
    - Like Lisp, the Actor Model had its roots in Artificial Intelligence
    research. This 1973 paper is the one that introduced the world to the Actor
    Model, which Erlang subsequently brought to the programming world of
    telecommunications and distributed systems.

    - Gul Agha's PhD. thesis which anticipated Erlang by about a year. (Note
    that Joe Armstrong was not aware of Dr. Agha's work at the time of Erlang's
    conception.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1459.pdf">Actor Model of Computation: Scalable Robust Information Systems</a>
    - a 2010 paper by Carl Hewitt (which he has updated regularly for the past
