# 2 Diving In

## 2.2 Atoms and Strings

### 2.2.1 Atoms

Atoms are a data type in Erlang that is used to represent non-numerical
constants. In LFE, the typographical limitations of Erlang don't apply, since
they're always quoted in LFE ;-)

Atoms have a value: the same as their text:

```lisp
> 'strag
strag
>
```
We saw this in the section on Boolean operators with the atoms of ``true``
and ``false``. Since there are no Boolean types in Erlang or LFE, the atoms
``true`` and ``false`` are used instead.

Here are some more examples of atoms:

```lisp
> 'Vogon
Vogon
> '_Gargle_Blaster
_Gargle_Blaster
> '+
+
> '*
*
> '|and now with hyperspace bypasses|
|and now with hyperspace bypasses|
>
```

Though very simple, atoms have a huge impact on our everyday use of Erlang and
LFE, primarily in the area of pattern matching. Hold that thought, though;
we're not quite ready for it yet!

Furthermore, atoms are stored differently in Erlang than strings. They take up
less space and are more efficient to compare than strings.

### 2.2.2 Strings

Now we come to the oddball of Erlang: the string. In truth, there is no such
thing. Strings in Erlang are just lists of integers:

```lisp
> "Don't Panic."
"Don't Panic."
> (list 68 111 110 39 116 32 80 97 110 105 99 46)
"Don't Panic."
>
```

Because Erlang (and thus LFE) strings consume 8 bytes per character on 32-bit
systems and 16 bytes on 64-bit systems, they are not very efficient. As such,
if you need to work with long strings in LFE, you probably want to use
``(binary ...)``, but that's in the next section :-)
