# 9 Development & Deployment

## 9.3 Creating a Library

We've seen the directory structure above for a library project. We're defining
a "library" project as one that doesn't start up any services as part of its
basic operations. Instead, it provides code that other projects make use of.

In particular, in a library project, you do not need to define `mod` in your
`ebin/libname.app` file. Similarly, in your `src` directory, you do not need
to create application nor supervisor files.

We're making a rather arbitrary distinction here (between "library" projects and
"service" projects, and one with undoubtedly many blurry lines. Regardless, it
may be instructive or useful as a guideline.

This section will make use of the following example project on github:
