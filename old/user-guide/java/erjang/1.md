# 10 Java Interop


## 10.2 Lisp Flavored Erjang

LFE running on Erjang transforms LFE into a close cousin of Clojure. It's
rather amazing, to be honest. To provide you the opportunity to share in this
amazement, this section of the LFE User Guide Java chapter is dedicated to
Erjang.


### 10.2.1 Introduction

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/krestenkrab">Kresten</a> and
<a href="http://www.trifork.com/">Trifork</a>, the Erlang community has the
option to run many of its libraries and services on the JVM with Erjang.

Key points of Erjang:

* It is a virtual machine for Erlang which runs on Java 7.
* It loads ``.beam`` files, compiles them to Java ``.class`` files and loads them into the JVM.
* It can boot Erlang/OTP to the Eshell.
* It runs ``mnesia``, with distribution across Erjang/BEAM nodes.

Smaller projects and libraries tend to run quite nicely on Erjang. Larger
systems like RabbitMQ and Riak boot, but still need some work. There is also
on-going work to fully support some of the fringe cases exposed by LFE.
