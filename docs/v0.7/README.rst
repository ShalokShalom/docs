Lisp Flavored Erlang
====================


The Github Site
---------------

This is the repo for the Github-hosted web site for Robert Virding's Lisp
implementation on the Erlang VM.

Checkout the `LFE web site`_.


Downloads
---------

We now have a `download page`_! From here, you can download the following
versions of the User Guide and the LFE tutorials:

* single-page HTML files

* combined markdown files

* and .mobi files for your Kindle!


Building an ebook
-----------------

If you would like to build the ebooks yourself, the ``Makefile`` will download
all of the dependencies except for Amazon's Kindle genereator, since you need
to acknowledge a user agreement for that bit. You can get that `here`_.
